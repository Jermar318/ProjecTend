# ProjecTend
Our goal was is to allow our user to track progress and multiple stages of a project, including each group member's specific participation within that project.

# User story:
As a user it is difficult to maintain all contributing people's ideas simultaneously. Weâ€™d like to have an easy descriptive place for all contributions and ideas allowing our agile development to flourish and mitigate stress on all involved.
