# <ProjecTend>

## Description

Track progress and multiple stages of a project, including each group member's specific participation within that project.

The motivation for creating ProjecTend stemmed from a desire to simplify and enhance team collaboration and project tracking. I wanted to build a tool that makes it easy for teams to stay organized, visualize progress, and ensure that tasks are managed efficiently. ProjecTend is designed to turn complex project management into a straightforward and engaging experience, helping teams achieve their goals with greater clarity and ease.

What was learned during the creation of this site was how to create and implement a restful api, how to incorporate SortableJS into the UI, and how to make a UI that interacts with an API.
